# ML Degrees Application Requirements

## Notes for Future Development

### Current Limitations

- No program categories or tags
- No detailed program information pages
- No user profiles or preferences
- No analytics or usage tracking

### Technical Debt

- Frontend TypeScript diagnostics need cleanup
- Error handling could be more robust
- API rate limiting not implemented
- Additional database indexes for performance could be optimized
- No caching layer implemented

### Architecture Decisions Made

- Monolithic frontend/backend separation
- PostgreSQL for primary data storage
- Google OAuth as only auth provider
- Simple voting system (no complex algorithms)
- Kubernetes-first deployment strategy
